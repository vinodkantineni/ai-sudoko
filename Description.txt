This project is a Sudoku Solver with a graphical interface built using Python's Tkinter library.
It allows users to select a puzzle difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard), loads a random Sudoku puzzle, and visually solves it using a backtracking algorithm.
The GUI highlights each number being filled step-by-step, providing an animated solving experience. A timer displays the duration it takes to solve the puzzle, giving users insight into the solver's speed.
The project is self-contained, with no external dependencies beyond Python's standard libraries. It demonstrates fundamental algorithmic techniques (backtracking) and GUI programming skills.
--Ideal for learning:
--Recursive algorithms
--Sudoku solving logic
--GUI development in Python
Fun to use and easy to run on any system with Python 3.x installed!.
